go-mastadon

A Go library for the Mastadon network.

This is a fork of go-mastodon by mattn (see, ATTRIBUTION) that adds
support for Pleroma extensions and makes some conservative
improvements to the library.

It's mostly backwards compatible, but you may need to make small
(but good) changes to your program. For example, many uses of
empty interfaces are gone, and are now pointers or plain values.

To add it to your project, run the following in its directory:

go get spiderden.org/masta
